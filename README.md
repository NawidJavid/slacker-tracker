# SlackerTracker

A brutally honest habit tracker that doesn't sugarcoat your failures or over-celebrate your wins. It tells it like it is.

## About

SlackerTracker is a web-based habit tracker that works entirely offline. It's designed to be:

- **Blunt**: Get roasted when you're slacking, and modest praise when you're consistent
- **Simple**: Add habits, track yes/no daily, see your streaks
- **Offline**: All data is stored in your browser's localStorage - no login, no backend, 100% private

## Features

- Add multiple daily habits to track
- Log whether you completed each habit daily
- View your current streak and missed day count for each habit
- Get "motivational" feedback based on your consistency
- Bold, fun UI with emoji status indicators
- Fully responsive design

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository or download the files
2. Open `index.html` in any modern web browser
3. Add your first habit and start tracking

## How It Works

- **Adding Habits**: Enter a habit name and click "Add Habit"
- **Tracking**: For each habit, click "Done Today" or "Nope" to log your daily progress
- **Viewing Stats**: Each habit card shows your current streak and total missed days
- **Feedback**: The app gives you different feedback messages based on your performance

## Technical Details

SlackerTracker is built with:
- HTML5
- CSS3 (with animations and responsive design)
- Vanilla JavaScript (no frameworks)
- localStorage API for data persistence

## Privacy

All data is stored locally in your browser using localStorage. Nothing is sent to any server, and no tracking or analytics are implemented.
